### More Info
 
You might want to Add Values to some Registry Key right? you can Add both String & Binary Values!

If you do not already know, Registry Keys are Opened or Created before Adding Values. This is performed to obtain a Handle for the desired Key (a handle is a unique integer identifying an object and is set by MS Windows OS)

Returns Status Info

like Success, Failure or Other.

None that I know of! :)
